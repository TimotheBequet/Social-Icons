Small round buttons which expands when we hover it.

### To add items:
add an `<li>` element, with in the style attribute the two colors that will make up the background of the enlarged button.
In this `<li>`, put an element `<a>` (with the link to the desired site), and in this `<a>` a `<span>` containing a Bootstrap icon ([https://icons.getbootstrap.com/](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)) and another `<span>` containing the title of the button that will appear when the cursor is hovered over.
